@Main.py will only work Kaggle.com along with the Digit Recognizer dataset. If you want to try other datasets, remember to change respective code to match the new data set.

If you want to use this code else where, such as VScode, then you must change "data = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/digit-recognizer/train.csv')" to respective folder that represents your chosen dataset.
